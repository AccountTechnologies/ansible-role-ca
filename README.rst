The repository contains a substantially modified version of the
`Anasible CA role`_ originally written by
`Haggai Phillip Zagury`_. The modifications fix a number of bugs,
add support for tags, and integrate the functionality of this
role in the model used by the `uw-dims/ansible-dims-playbooks`_
repository.
